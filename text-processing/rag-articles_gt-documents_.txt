Marseille, France ( CNN ) The French prosecutor leading an investigation into the crash of Germanwings Flight 9525 insisted Wednesday that he was not aware of any video footage from on board the plane. Reports by Bild and Paris Match claimed a phone video existed showing the final seconds, but investigators denied this. All 150 people on board were killed when the plane crashed in the French Alps. Lufthansa later confirmed that the co-pilot Andreas Lubitz had previously suffered from severe depression.
( CNN ) Amnesty International released its annual death penalty report, highlighting both progress and setbacks. The number of executions worldwide fell by almost 22% compared to the previous year, but the number of death sentences increased by 28%.
